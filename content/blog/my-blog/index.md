description: The best free blogging platforms in 2022
---
The best free blogging platforms gives you something that social media can't: the ability to take control of your identity, your message and your personal brand. 

Because let's be realistic: when you share your work on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube or TikTok, it's the platform's algorithm that decides when, where and even if your followers get to see your posts. Build your own blog, though, and you'll have total control over how your work is presented, and in what order it appears.

There are two reasons why most people don't set up a blog: it seems too complicated and they worry about the cost. So in this article, we've gathered together the best free blogging platforms, all of which are pretty easy to use. 

Many of them allow you to use ready-made templates, so you won't need any web design or coding skills. If you're very new to blogging, though, you may want to read our guide to [how to start a blog](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/how-to-start-a-blog-1131726) first. Conversely, if you're a web designer, we've included more advanced free blogging platforms that will allow you to customise things to your heart's content.
